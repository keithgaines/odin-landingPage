# The Odin Project - Landing Page
<p>I built this webpage as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. They give you an image of the page's layout <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png">here</a> and styling (hex codes for colors, etc) <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png">here</a>, and then you build it using the skills from previous lessons. The images are all stock photos taken from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>. With the exception of the Pexels link, none of the other links or buttons on this page actually do anything. They're strictly for show.</p>
